# Dark Moon
## Description
Dark Moon is a game based on the '80 arcade game Lunar Lander. The player attempts to land a capsule on the moon with limited fuel and turning capability.
## Team
The team consisted of the following people: Tameem (me), Ziyan, and Elizabeth. We all worked on this project using Unity as part of our Game Design course.

We started work in Winter 2019 and stopped working on it in Spring 2020. Due to that, there are still some bugs in the sounds and with the game end screen but the overall game is playable. We definitely learned the hard way that game development takes much longer than what one might think.
## How to play?
There are Mac and Windows build on the releases tab. Just download and play!
## IMPORTANT NOTE
Unity and Git do not play well together. At all. The source code you see here is what we used to build the game in Unity but most of the resources will be corrupt if one tries to download the src from here and build the game. During development we used Unity Collab for version control instead of Git. I just uploaded it to GitHub for reference. 

Built using Unity3D version 2019.4.17
